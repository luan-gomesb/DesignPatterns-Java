# Delagation Rpinciple

Is the concept fo delegate a behavior to another class
a class that knows whats need to be done.

you don't need to know what to do, the claas does it

delegation is a example of object composition

- you can use another object composition as  a mechaninsm for code reuse

is better than inheritance for many case

Several design patterns use delegation

State = an Object delegate request to a State object that represents its current state

Strategy -  on object delegates a specific request to an object that represents a strategy for carrying out the request

Visitor - the operation that gets performed on each element of an object structure is always delegated to the Visitor object
